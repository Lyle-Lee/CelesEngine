# Celes Engine

This is primarily an early-stage interactive application and renderer for Windows.
The main purpose is for experiments in Computer Graphics.
Currently not much is implemented but more related algorithms will be available and to be interactive in the future.

# Getting Started

Visual Stduio 2019 or 2022 is recomended.

<ins>**1. Downloading the repository:**</ins>

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone git@github.com:Lyle-Lee/CelesEngine.git`.

<ins>**2. Setup the project:**</ins>

Download GLEW and put `glew32.lib` and `glew32s.lib` under `CelesEngine/Dependencies/GLEW/lib/x64/`.
Then build the project.

# Main features to come:

* Fast 2D rendering (UI, particles, etc.).
* High quality real-time physically-based 3D rendering.
* Support for MacOS, iOS, Android and Linux.
	* Native graphics API support (DirectX, Vulkan, Metal).
* Fully featured viewer and editor applications.
* Fully scripted interaction and behavior.
* Integrated 3rd party 2D and 3D physics engine.
* Procedural terrain and world generation.
* Artificial Inteligence.
* Audio system.
